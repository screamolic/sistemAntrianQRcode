# sistemAntrianQRcode — Project Memory

> Auto-synced | 312 observations

**Stack:** JavaScript/TypeScript · Next.js + React + Tailwind · DB: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Prisma

## 🏛️ CORE ARCHITECTURE

> **CRITICAL:** The following rules represent strict architectural boundaries defined by the user. NEVER violate them in your generated code or explanations.

# Intellectual Property & Architecture Rules

Write your strict architectural boundaries here.
BrainSync will automatically enforce these rules across all agents (Cursor, Windsurf, Cline)
and inject them into the memory context.

Example:

- NEVER use TailwindCSS. Only use vanilla CSS.
- NEVER write class components. Only use functional React components.

## 🛡️ GLOBAL SAFETY RULES

- **NEVER** run `git clean -fd` or `git reset --hard` without checking `git log` and verifying commits exist.
- **NEVER** delete untracked files or folders blindly. Always backup or stash before bulk edits.

## 🧭 ACTIVE CONTEXT

> Always read `.cursor/active-context.md` for exact instructions on the specific file you are currently editing. It updates dynamically.

## 🔴 STOP — READ THESE FIRST

- **Don't mix Tailwind with inline styles** — Don't mix Tailwind with inline styles
- **Use prisma migrate deploy in production, not prisma db push** — Use prisma migrate deploy in production, not prisma db push
- **Run prisma generate after schema changes** — Run prisma generate after schema changes
- **Don't import server-only code in client components** — Don't import server-only code in client components
- **Environment variables: NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix for client-side only** — Environment variables: NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix for client-side only

## 📐 Conventions

- Extract repeated class patterns into components
- Use responsive prefixes consistently (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:)
- Don't use arbitrary values when a utility class exists
- Use select/include to limit data fetched — avoid over-fetching
- Use transactions for related database operations
- Use middleware.ts for authentication guards, not client-side checks
- Use next/image (not img tag) for automatic optimization
- Handle loading.tsx and error.tsx for every async route

## ⚡ Available Tools (ON-DEMAND only)
- `save(title, content, category)` — Save a note + auto-detect conflicts
- `batch_save(items[])` — Save multiple notes in 1 call
- `query(text)` — Search memory for architecture, past fixes, decisions
- `search(text)` — Full-text search for details
- `check_errors()` — Check compiler errors after edits

> ℹ️ DO NOT call get_context() or get_gotchas() at startup — context above IS your context.
